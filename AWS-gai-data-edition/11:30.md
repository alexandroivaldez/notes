# Customizing Generative AI Applications for Your Business Using Your Data

```md
Customizing model responses enables you to deliver differentiated and personalized user experiences. In this session, learn about the different customization techniques offered by Amazon Bedrock, including model fine-tuning and continued pre-training as well as native support for end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver more relevant and accurate responses using your proprietary data.
```

## Agenda

1. Approaches for customizing generativer AI solutions
2. Amazon Bedrock overview
3. Retrieval-augmented genera

## Why customize?

Customize for specific business needs. Context aware. Most recent data.

- Example: Healthcare - Understand  medical terminology and provide accurate responses related to a patient's health.

Foundation Model -> Customization -> Your Data -> Foundation Model

## Approaches for customizing generative AI solutions

- Knowledge bases
  - Augment model with relatively static data without changing weights.
  - Contextual information based on user's query.
  - Medium - once new data arrives
- Agents
  - Augment model with dynamic data without changing weights.
  - Contextual information based on user's query.
  - Frequent - every time a database changes.
- Fine-tuning
  - Maximizing accuracy for specific tasks.
  - Small number of labeled examples.
  - Infrequent - only necessary when task changes context.
- Continued Pre-training
  - Maximizing model accuracy for your domain
  - Large number of unlabeled datasets
  - Infrequent - only necessary if domain changes.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval - Fetches the relevant content from the external knowledge base or data sources based on a user query.

Augmentation - Adding the retrieved relevant context to the user prompt, which goes as an input to the foundation model.

Generation - Response from the foundation model based on the augmented prompt.

### RAG Use Cases

Improved Content Quality

- Helps in reducing hallucinations
- Connects with recent knowledge, including enterprise data

Contextual Chatbots and Question Answering

- Enhances chatbot capabilities by integrating with real-time data.

Personalized Search

- Searches based on a user's previous search history and persona.

Real-time Data Summarization

- Retrieves and summarizes transactional data from databases or API calls.
