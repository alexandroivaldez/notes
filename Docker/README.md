# Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker is a virtualization software, makes developing and deploying software easier. It packages application with all the necessary dependencies, configuration, system tools and runtime. It containerizes everything the application needs to run.

## What problems does Docker solve?

Every developer on a team needs to install all the dependencies on their local machine in order to use/work on a specific app.

- There can be installation errors, wrong dependencies, etc. There's a lot of room for error.

Docker solves this with the use of containers. Containers have everything packaged ready to use for each developer regardless of OS and what services are needed. Saves a lot of headaches!
