# Supervised VS Unsupervised Machine Learning

```hs
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." - Arthur Samuel (1959)
```

## Supervised Learning

Data comes with inputs x and outputs labels y. The algorithm learns from being give "right answers".

```hs
x (input) -> y (output label)
```

### Regression

A type of supervised learning algorithm that predicts an output label from an **infinite** number of possible options.

### Classification

A type of supervised learning algorithm that predicts an output label from an **finite** number of possible options. These options are known as "classes" or "categories".

## Unsupervised Learning

As opposed to supervised learning, where data comes with inputs x AND outputs labels y. Unsupervised learning only comes with inputs x, but no output labels y. It is up to the algorithm top find the structure or labels in the data.

### Clustering

- Group similar data points together.

### Anomaly Detection

- Find unusual data points.

### Dimensionality Reduction

- Compress data using fewer numbers.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Default environment to code and test ML code. This is the exact same environment and tool that many large companies are using for their ML code.
