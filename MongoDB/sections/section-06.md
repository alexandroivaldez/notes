[Home](../README.md)

## Drivers

Drivers work in tandem with built-in Node.js BSON package to interact with your MongoDB server. Drivers allow you to specify the connection options.

MongoDB provides asynchronous drivers for Node.js and other programming languages.

### Network Access Errors - Normally your IP isn't part of the allowed list.

### User Authentication Errors - Check password details in database, check username and password in the connection string.
