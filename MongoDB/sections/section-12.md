## Using MongoDB Aggregation Stages with Node.js: $match and $group

Review the following code, which demonstrates how to build the $match and $group stages of an aggregation pipeline in MongoDB with Node.js.

## Using $match

Aggregation gives you a way to transform data from your collection by passing documents from one stage to another. These stages can consist of operators that transform or organize your data in a specific way. In this lesson, we used $match and $group.

The $match stage filters documents by using a simple equality match, like $match: { author: "Dave"}, or aggregation expressions using comparison operators, like $match: { likes: { $gt: 100 } }. This operator accepts a query document and passes the resulting documents to the next stage. $match should be placed early in your pipeline to reduce the number of documents to process.


## Using $group

The $group stage separates documents according to a group key and returns one document for every unique group key. The group key is usually a field in the document, but it can also be an expression that resolves to a field. The $group stage can be used with aggregation expressions to perform calculations on the grouped documents. An example of this is adding up the total number of movie tickets sold by using the $sum operator:

```js
    $group: { _id: "$movie", totalTickets: { $sum: "$tickets" } }
```

The "$movie" is the group key, and the totalTickets field is the result of the $sum operator.

In the following code, we assign our collection name to a variable for convenience. First, we declare some variables to hold the database connection and the collection we'll use:

```js
const client = new MongoClient(uri)
const dbname = "bank";
const collection_name = "accounts";
const accountsCollection = client.db(dbname).collection(collection_name);
Next, we build an aggregation pipeline that uses $match and $group and that will find accounts with a balance of less than $1,000. Then we group the results by the account_type, and calculate the total_balance and avg_balance for each type.

const pipeline = [
  // Stage 1: match the accounts with a balance less than $1,000
  { $match: { balance: { $lt: 1000 } } },
  // Stage 2: Calculate average balance and total balance
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$account_type",
      total_balance: { $sum: "$balance" },
      avg_balance: { $avg: "$balance" },
    },
  },
]
```

To run an aggregation pipeline, we append the aggregate method to the collection. The aggregate method takes an array of stages as an argument, which is stored in a variable. The aggregate method returns a cursor that we can iterate over to get the results.

```js
const main = async () => {
  try {
    await client.connect()
    console.log(`Connected to the database üåç. \nFull connection string: ${safeURI}`)
    let result = await accountsCollection.aggregate(pipeline)
    for await (const doc of result) {
      console.log(doc)
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error connecting to the database: ${err}`)
  } finally {
    await client.close()
  }
}

main()
```

## Using MongoDB Aggregation Stages with Node.js: $sort and $project

Review the following code, which demonstrates how to build the $sort and $project stages of an aggregation pipeline in MongoDB with Node.js.

## $sort

Aggregation is a powerful tool that gives us the ability to compute and transform our data. In this lesson, we focused on the $sort and $project stages.

The $sort stage takes all the input documents and sorts them in a specific order. The documents can be sorted in numerical, alphabetical, ascending, or descending order.

The $sort stage accepts a sort key that specifies the field to sort on. The sort key can be 1 for ascending order or -1 for descending order. For example:

{ $sort: { balance: 1 } } sorts the documents in ascending order by the balance field.

{ $sort: { balance: -1 } } sorts the documents in descending order by the balance field.

## $project

The $project stage takes all the input documents and passes along only a subset of the fields in those documents by specifying the fields to include or exclude.

For example, if we want our resulting documents to include only the account_id, we write { $project: { _id: 0, account_id: 1 } }. The _id field is excluded by setting it to 0, and the account_id field is included by setting it to 1.

The $project stage can also create new computed fields based on data from the original documents. An example of this is creating a projected field that contains someone's full name, where only the first and last names are stored in the original document.

In the following example, we build an aggregation pipeline that uses $match, $sort, and $project, and that will find checking accounts with a balance of greater than or equal to $1,500. Then, we sort the results by the balance in descending order and return only the account_id, account_type, balance, and a new computed field named gbp_balance, which stands for Great British Pounds (GBP) balance.

```js
const pipeline = [
  // Stage 1: $match - filter the documents (checking, balance >= 1500)
  { $match: { account_type: "checking", balance: { $gte: 1500 } } },

  // Stage 2: $sort - sorts the documents in descending order (balance)
  { $sort: { balance: -1 } },

  // Stage 3: $project - project only the requested fields and one computed field (account_type, account_id, balance, gbp_balance)
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      account_id: 1,
      account_type: 1,
      balance: 1,
      // GBP stands for Great British Pound
      gbp_balance: { $divide: ["$balance", 1.3] },
    },
  },
]
```

To run an aggregation pipeline, we append the aggregate method to the collection. The aggregate method takes an array of stages as an argument, which is stored here as a variable. The aggregate method returns a cursor that we can iterate over to get the results.

```js
const main = async () => {
  try {
    await client.connect()
    console.log(`Connected to the database üåç\n ${uri}`)
    let accounts = client.db("bank").collection("accounts")
    let result = await accounts.aggregate(pipeline)
    for await (const doc of result) {
      console.log(doc)
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error connecting to the database: ${err}`)
  } finally {
    await client.close()
  }
}

main()
```
