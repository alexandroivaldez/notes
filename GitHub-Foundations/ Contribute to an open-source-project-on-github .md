# Contribute to an open-source project on GitHub



After you've communicated your intent to help the project, you're now ready to start working on your actual contribution.

Your contribution will take the form of a pull request or PR. A pull request is a special place on GitHub that contains a few things:

- A title and description for your changes.
- One or more commits that constitute the changes you're proposing.
- Comments, where everyone can participate in a discussion about the changes.
- Code reviews, where you can find detailed feedback on your changes and eventually commit suggestions.
- Status checks that come, for example, from automated tests that the maintainers might have put in place. Status checks can serve different purposes. For example, they can ensure that your changes follow the project's rules, or that your changes don't break the code.
- After a pull request is created, it can be updated with new commits, comments, or code reviews. This process continues until the project maintainers approve and merge the pull request or reject the changes and close the pull request. When your pull request is merged, it means that your changes have been integrated into the project's codebase.

Steps:

fork > clone fork locally > create new branch > make changes/commits > git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME>
