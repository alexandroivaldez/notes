# Gists

Gists provided a simple way to share code snippets with others. Every gist is a Git repository, which means they can be forked and cloned.

Gists can be public or secret.

- public gists are searchable
- public gists show in in Discover
- private gists are not searchable and do not show up in discovery, BUT private gists are not private. You can share the URL with friends.
- secret gists can be changed to be public, but public gists cannot be changed to be private.
- You can pin Gists to your profile for other to easily find.
