# Code with GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is an instant, cloud-based development environment that uses a container to provide you with common languages, tools, and utilities for development.

A Codespace's lifecycle begins when you create a Codespace and ends when you delete it. You can disconnect and reconnect to an active Codespace without affecting its running processes. You can stop and restart a Codespace without losing the changes that you make to your project.

You can create a Codespace on GitHub.com, in Visual Studio Code, or by GitHub CLI. There are four ways to create a Codespace:

- From a GitHub template or any template repository on GitHub.com to start a new project.
- From a branch in your repository for new feature work.
- From an open pull request to explore work-in-progress.
- From a commit in a repository's history to investigate a bug at a specific point in time.

When creating a GitHub Codespace, four processes occur:

1. VM and storage are assigned to your Codespace.
2. A container is created.
3. A connection to the Codespace is made.
4. A post-creation setup is made.

## Codespaces VS GitHub.dev

You can use GitHub.dev to navigate files and sources code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in GitHub.dev editor.

If you want to do more heavy lifting like testing your code, use GitHub Codespaces. It has compute associated with it so you can build your code, run your code, and have terminal access. GitHub.dev doesn't have compute in it. With GitHub Codespaces, you get the power of a personal Virtual Machine (VM) with terminal access, the same way you could use your local environment, just in the cloud.
