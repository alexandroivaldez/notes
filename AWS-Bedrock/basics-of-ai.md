## What is AI?

The science of making computers mimic human itelligence and decision making.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning - Algorithm is trained on data to make predictions on new data based on the training data.

### Supervised Learning

Algorithms are ttrained using labeled data. Raw data that has labels on it. The algorithm is trained on the labeled data and generates a model that can determine and id what the input data is.

- **Classification**
    - Determining
- **Regression**
    - Forecasting

### Unsupervised Learning

Algorithm is trained using unlabeled data. The model finds hidden patterns and insights based on the similiarites between the data.

- **Clustering**

- **Association**

### Reinforcement Learning

Algorithm is trained using a trial and error approach.
- Reward and feedback.

## What is Deep Learning and Neural Networks?

Neural networks mimic the structure of the human brain. Deep Learning builds these neural networks.

### Key Terms

- Neurons - compute nodes that return a probability
- Weights - the power each node has to determine a specific probability. For example, determining a square vs circle.
- Bias - Accounts for devient values
- Threshold - x1w1 + x2w2 + ...
- Activation Function - Nodes that are activated, these activated nodes create the neaural pathway.
- Feedforward Network - The one way path from input to output
- Actual Output - What the output of the model was.
- Error - The difference between the actual value and what was returned.
- Forward Propagation - 
- Backward Propagation - Passing the error values back to the weights.
